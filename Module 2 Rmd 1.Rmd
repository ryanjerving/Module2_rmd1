# Level 1 header

## R Markdown

### Level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here's a link to visit [The Viper](https://theviper.org)

Formatting in **bold** or *italics*.

When we compile, we'll use the `R Markdown` package.

To make a list, do this:

* Breakfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + bacon
        + toast
    - drinks
        + coffee
        + OJ
        + milk
* Lunch
    - taco

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure2, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}

plot(pressure)

```

## Insert Tables

```{r cars-table, echo = FALSE}

knitr::kable(head(cars),
             caption = "Top 6 Rows of Cars Data Set")

```

## Inserting Equataions

Using LaTeX syntax, a linear regression model might look like this:

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \epsilon$$

## Inserting Images

Here is an image inserted from a file in my own repository:

## Inserting Animated GIFs and Video

![sunstar GIF](sunstar/sunstar.gif)

![sunstar video](sunstar/sunstar.mp4)

## Insert Text with some Footnotes

Here is a footnote reference. [^1] and another [^longnote]

Here is an inline note. ^[Inline notes track the number for us.]

[^1]: Here is the actual footnote at the end of the document.
[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.
