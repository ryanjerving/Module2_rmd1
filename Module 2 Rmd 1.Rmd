# Level 1 header

## R Markdown

### Level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here's a link to visit [The Viper](https://theviper.org)

Formatting in **bold** or *italics*.

When we compile, we'll use the `R Markdown` package.

To make a list, do this:

* Breakfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + bacon
        + toast
    - drinks
        + coffee
        + OJ
        + milk
* Lunch
    - taco

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure2, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}

plot(pressure)

```

## Insert Tables

```{r}

knitr::kable(head(cars))

```
